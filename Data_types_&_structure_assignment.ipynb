        "   In Python, a dictionary stores data as key-value pairs using a structure called a hash table. When a key-value pair is added, Python calculates a unique hash value for the key using the built-in hash() function. This hash determines where the data is stored in memory. Keys must be immutable and unique, while values can be of any type and may be duplicated. The dictionary uses the hash to quickly locate values, making operations like insertion, deletion, and lookup very fast—typically in constant time (O(1)). If two keys produce the same hash (a collision), Python uses methods like open addressing to resolve it."

Sets automatically eliminate duplicates, making them ideal for tasks like removing repeated values or checking membership efficiently. While lists maintain order and allow duplicates, sets are unordered and do not allow duplicate items, which simplifies certain operations. Additionally, membership tests (using the in keyword) are generally faster with sets than with lists because sets use a hash-based structure, whereas lists require scanning each element. Therefore, if your main goal is to store unique items and perform fast lookups, a set is the better choice."

While strings are specifically designed for handling textual data, lists provide a more general-purpose container for various types of data. Additionally, strings support many text-specific operations like slicing, searching, and formatting, whereas lists offer methods to manipulate their elements such as appending, sorting, or extending.

One major advantage is **fast lookup**: accessing a value by its key in a dictionary is typically much quicker (average O(1) time) compared to searching for an item in a list, which can take longer (O(n)) if you have to check each element. Dictionaries also allow you to use meaningful keys instead of numeric indexes, making the code more readable and easier to work with, especially when dealing with complex data. Additionally, dictionaries enforce **unique keys**, which helps organize data without duplicates in keys, while lists can contain duplicate items. This makes dictionaries ideal for tasks like counting occurrences, grouping data, or representing objects with named attributes.\n",

Using a tuple here ensures the data stays consistent and protects it from changes.
